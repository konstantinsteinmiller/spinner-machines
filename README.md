## Future Features Roadmap

Features rated on impact to three KPIs (1–5 scale each, 5 = highest impact):

- **Conversion** — likelihood a new player stays past 1 minute
- **Play Time** — average session length increase
- **Retention** — probability of return visits over 7/30 days

**Overall Score** = weighted average: Conversion × 0.3 + Play Time × 0.3 + Retention × 0.4
